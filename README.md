# MachineLearning_NaiveBayes_MEDLINE

This project implements an improved version of the standard Naive Bayes machine learning algorithim on the MEDLINE database. 
The task is to predict the domain of an abstract research paper from the domains, Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota or Virus. 

In the submitted notebook, I explore modifications to the standard Naive Bayes implmentaion and evaluate their performance. 

Because I am using a Naive Bayes approach to the task, I have the following assumption: All atributes are conditionally indepenedent of eachother in a given class. 


This task was as part of the following Kaggle challenge, https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/naivebayes-21/data.
